# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


To start server navigate to server folder and "npm start" and to start client navigate to client folder then to My-project-portfolio and type "npm run dev" in terminal

On deploy change localhost to render on card.jsx, addnewproject.jsx, home.jsx, login.jsx, and signup.jsx
